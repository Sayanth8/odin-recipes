        <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <p class="paragraph txt">These French silk pie bars are sooo good. They consist of a chocolate crust, followed 
            by a chocolate mousse layer topped with whipped cream with just a little tang 
            from cream cheese. You can't go wrong with these!</p>
